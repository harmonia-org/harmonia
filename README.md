# harmonia
Harmonia is a Discord client mod that takes a new approach to modding your Discord.

### Harmonia is still in *very* early alpha.
In fact, it doesn't really do, well, anything right now...

However, you can read our roadmap for what we'd like to implement and what our "new approach" is below!

## What do you mean, 'new approach'?
The main quirk of Harmonia is that, by itself, it doesn't have much functionality. To make sure it is as debloated as possible, the client will have to be extended with 'libraries'. Some examples for these could be: a CSS/SCSS loader, methods of interacting with Discord's webpack, etc. Plugin developers will be able to write their own libraries, too!

## Roadmap
* Injection method - Using GooseUpdate - perhaps temporarily?
* Library loading - No progress, yet™️
* Plugin loading - No progress, yet™️
